# colour-spiral
A color spiral is a visually appealing pattern where a spiral is drawn with continuously changing colors. Using the Python turtle library, you can create a smooth spiral effect by gradually increasing the spiralâ€™s radius and altering the color at each step. The turtle's path forms a swirl.
